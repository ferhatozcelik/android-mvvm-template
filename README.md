This is an Android project template that demonstrates the use of the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture along with modern Android architecture components. It provides a structured starting point for building Android applications that are maintainable, testable, and scalable.

## Project Architecture

This app follows the MVVM architecture pattern, which stands for "Model-View-ViewModel." Here's an overview of each component:

- **Model:** Responsible for data and business logic. Independent of UI.
- **View:** Displays UI elements and interacts with users.
- **ViewModel:** Acts as a bridge between Model and View. Manages data presentation and user interactions. UI-independent.

MVVM promotes separation of concerns, making your codebase more organized and easier to manage. It also supports data binding, automatic synchronization of data between ViewModel and View, and allows for more effective testing.
